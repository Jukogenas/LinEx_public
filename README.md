# LinEx_public
A tool for the automated generation of efficient linear algebra expressions.

I suggest starting with main.py for a simple example. No non-default packages are required.

test.py offers a few more options and more insight into the generator, but isn't fully documented. In addition, the package plantuml may be required to draw graphs as part of the debug output (can be disabled).
