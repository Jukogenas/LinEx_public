# Binary element-wise functions:

A+eye

a+b
x+y
A+B
a-b
x-y

a.*b
x.*y
A.*B
a./b
x./y
A./B
a.^b
x.^b
A.^b
# Why are these two forbidden? They could work element-to-element wise (like .*)
# How does the current behaviour of A.^b differ from A^b?
# Actually, nevermind: A^b fails with a nonsensical error message.
#x.^y
#A.^B

# Other binary functions:
a*b
