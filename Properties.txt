Properties ...
... that determine the shape of a variable:
scalar
vector
covector
matrix
square_matrix

... based on entries being zero:
diagonal
triangle_upper
triangle_lower

... based on values being the same:
symmetric
pseudo_scalar

... for recognition of constants and neutral elements (internal use only):
constant
zero
one

... other (these are pretty complicated, but important for matrix factorization):
pos_def
pos_semi_def
neg_def
neg_semi_def
(These also work for scalars, although the names are a bit misleading in that case).
